## Description
This is a simple physics based racing game that I have been working on for a few months. It was made with C# and the Unity Game Engine. I did the coding, however the assets were not created by me. This game right now is only playable with a controller or a racing wheel but I might eventually add keyboard support.

## How to work on this game yourself
Feel free to download the file, and open it as a new project in unity. Everything should work out of the box. Just don't claim it as your own. (:
